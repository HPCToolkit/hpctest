# HPCTest

This is a fork of hpctoolkit-tests which will use the Spack package manager
to enumerate a space of test configurations and built corresponding versions
of each test. hpctoolkit-tests is a collection of unit tests and stress tests of
various types for HPCToolkit and some of its important prerequisites, very early and fluid.

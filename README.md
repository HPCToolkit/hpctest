# hpctoolkit-tests

This is a fork of hpctoolkit-tests which will use the Spack package manager
to enumerate a space of test configurations and built corresponding versions
of each test.

hpctoolkit-tests is a collection of unit tests and stress tests of
various types for HPCToolkit and some of its important prerequisites.

Very early, very fluid, subject to change and reorganization.

SPECIFYING PROFILE PARAMS
=========================

Hpctest lets you specify "profiling" arguments to be passed to hpcrun, hpcstruct, 
and hpcprof on their command lines when hpctest executes them as part of a test run.
You can specify profiling arguments when you run tests by putting them on hpctest's
command line with the '--profile' argument, or you can specify them in your
config.yaml file, where they become the defaults for all future hpctest commands.
If you don't specify any profiling arguments, hpctest uses builtin defaults:
"-e REALTIME@10000" for hpcrun, nothing for hpcstruct and hpcprof.

Here's how you specify profiling arguments:

(1) On the hpctest command line, profiling arguments for all three tools must be
given at the same time, separated by colons. So hpctest's defaults can be specified
by '-e REALTIME@10000 : : '. A more complicated profile spec might be

	'-e REALTIME@10000 -e IO : -I mysrc : -M stats --force-metric'
	
Unfortunately, writing profile specs on the hpctest command line is complicated by
most shells' treatment of quotes: they are essentially ignored, and cannot be used
to quote the contents of a profile spec. So special characters like ' ' and '-' in
specs are seen by the shell even if quoted, and confuse the shell. Sad! Hpctest
provides alternate characters for use in profile specs on the command line:

    '_' -> '-' and '.' -> ' '
    
With these, the complex spec shown above can be written safely, if unattractively,
in the shell as follows:

	'_e.REALTIME@10000._e.IO.:._I.mysrc.:._M.stats.__-force_metric'
	
Sadly this means the ordinary characters '_' and '.' can't be used in specs! Arghh.

HPCTEST BUGS
============

- 'build time' is reported as zero after spending a long time building builtin 'branson'..

- fib-noread must be built every time
	- can't copy the unreadable excutable to fully install
	- => have to build anew every time
	- but Spack treats every 'dev-build' execution as yielding a unique package!?
	- so... uninstall before building>

- check validity of each dimspec before starting, e.g. '%gccc@5.3.1' [sic!]

- check each dimension for emptiness; requires each Dimension class to evaluate its spec

- when test fails, automatically print output from the failed phase

- Must print additional report line w/ hpctk path if matrix has > 1 hpctk

- hpctest clean -d does not entirely delete all built dependencies. Survivors include
  amg2013@1.0 or amg2006@1.0.

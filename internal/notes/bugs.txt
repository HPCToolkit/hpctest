HPCTEST BUGS
============

- fib-noread fails if a;ready built bc its executable is not in build directory

- check validity of each dimspec before starting, e.g. '%gccc@5.3.1' [sic!]

- check each dimension for emptiness; requires each Dimension class to evaluate its spec

- when test fails, automatically print output from the failed phase

- Must print additional report line w/ hpctk path if matrix has > 1 hpctk

- hpctest clean -d does not entirely delete all built dependencies. Survivors are:
  - libtool
  - m4
  - miniamr
  - pkg-config
  - util-macros

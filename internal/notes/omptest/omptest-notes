Omptest NOTES

- Runs a number of OpenMP benchmark kernels and for each one, prints a line
  containing the high resolution real time, high resolution virtual real time
  (execution time), and benchmark name. I think the virtual real time corresponds
  to hpctoolkit's REALTIME metric.
  
- The line looks like this:

	X  26.777         1.861    pardo_
	
  where the 'X' is in column one.
  
- On les a run takes about 57.5 minutes. On gpu it takes about 8 minutes.

  description: >
    Nekbone is captures the basic structure and user interface of the
    extensive Nek5000 software. Nek5000 is a high order, incompressible
    Navier-Stokes solver based on the spectral element method. It has
    a wide range of applications and intricate customizations available
    to users. Nekbone, on the other hand, solves a Helmholtz equation
    in a box, using the spectral element method. It is pared down to
    include only the necessary features to compile, run, and solve the
    applications found in the test/ directory. Since almost all practical
    applications are in the three dimensional space, the solver is
    set to work with three dimensional geometries as default. Nekbone
    solves a standard Poisson equation using a conjugate gradient iteration
    with a simple preconditioner on a block or linear geometry (set
    within the test directory of the simulation). Nekbone exposes the
    principal computational kernel to reveal the essential elements of
    the algorithmic-architectural coupling that is pertinent to Nek5000.

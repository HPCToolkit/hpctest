  description: >
    This tests that hpcrun doesn't deadlock on malloc() and free().
    
    (1) hpcrun -e REALTIME@500 memstress 30 4
    
    This runs for 30 seconds, 4 threads, 2000 interrupts per second which is reasonable.
    This much should work. Succeeds if dlstress terminates normally and prints 'done'.
    Fails if deadlock or crash.
    
    (2) hpcrun -e MEMLEAK memstress 30 4
    
    This tests the memleak source. This may or may not work. It's *supposed* to work,
    but memleak is old and subject to bit rot. Succeeds if dlstress terminates normally
    and prints 'done'. Fails if deadlock or crash.
    
    If this test fails, it will fail non-deterministically. To stress it further,
    Mark suggests running it multiple times rather than for a longer time.

  name:  dlstress
  version: 1.0
  description: >
    This tests whether hpcrun deadlocks on dlopen(), dlclose() and optionally dlsym(). 
    
    (1) hpcrun -e REALTIME@500 dlstress 30 mult nosym
    
    This runs for 30 seconds with a fast rate of interrupts and tests that hpcrun doesn't
    deadlock with dlopen and dlclose. This much will work today. Succeeds if dlstress
    terminates normally and prints 'done'. Fails if deadlock or crash.

    (2) hpcrun -e REALTIME@500 dlstress 30 mult nosym
    
    This tests dlopen, dlclose and also dlsym. Currently this  ought to work but in fact will
    deadlock non-deterministically. Succeeds if dlstress terminates normally and prints 'done'.
    Fails if deadlock or crash.

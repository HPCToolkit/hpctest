  description: >
    Many important simulation problems of interest to DOE involve complex multi-material
    systems that undergo large deformations. LULESH is a highly simplified application
    that represents the numerical algorithms, data motion, and programming style typical
    in scientific C or C++ based hydrodynamic applications. The Shock Hydrodynamics
    Challenge Problem was originally defined and implemented by LLNL as one of five
    challenge problems in the DARPA UHPC program and has since become a widely studied
    proxy application in DOE co-design efforts for exascale. It has been ported to a number
    of programming models and optimized for a number of advanced platforms.

    description: >
        Many important simulation problems of interest to DOE involve complex multi-material
        systems that undergo large deformations. LULESH is a highly simplified application
        that represents the numerical algorithms, data motion, and programming style typical
        in scientific C or C++ based hydrodynamic applications. The Shock Hydrodynamics
        Challenge Problem was originally defined and implemented by LLNL as one of five
        challenge problems in the DARPA UHPC program and has since become a widely studied
        proxy application in DOE co-design efforts for exascale. It has been ported to a number
        of programming models and optimized for a number of advanced platforms.

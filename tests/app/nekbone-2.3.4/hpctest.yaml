        Nekbone is captures the basic structure and user interface of the
        extensive Nek5000 software. Nek5000 is a high order, incompressible
        Navier-Stokes solver based on the spectral element method. It has
        a wide range of applications and intricate customizations available
        to users. Nekbone, on the other hand, solves a Helmholtz equation
        in a box, using the spectral element method. It is pared down to
        include only the necessary features to compile, run, and solve the
        applications found in the test/ directory. Since almost all practical
        applications are in the three dimensional space, the solver is
        set to work with three dimensional geometries as default. Nekbone
        solves a standard Poisson equation using a conjugate gradient iteration
        with a simple preconditioner on a block or linear geometry (set
        within the test directory of the simulation). Nekbone exposes the
        principal computational kernel to reveal the essential elements of
        the algorithmic-architectural coupling that is pertinent to Nek5000.

   Proxy Application. CoSP2 represents a sparse linear algebra parallel 
   algorithm for calculating the density matrix in electronic structure 
   theory. The algorithm is based on a recursive second-order Fermi-
   Operator expansion method (SP2) and is tailored for density functional 
   based tight-binding calculations of non-metallic systems.

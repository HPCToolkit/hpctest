  description: >
    Quicksilver is a proxy application that represents some elements of
    the Mercury workload by solving a simpliÔ¨Åed dynamic monte carlo
    particle transport problem.  Quicksilver attempts to replicate the
    memory access patterns, communication patterns, and the branching or
    divergence of Mercury for problems using multigroup cross sections.
    OpenMP and MPI are used for parallelization.  A GPU version is
    available.  Unified memory is assumed.
    
    Performance of Quicksilver is likely to be dominated by latency bound
    table look-ups, a highly branchy/divergent code path, and poor
    vectorization potential.

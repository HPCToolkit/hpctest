    The Particle-In-Cell Scalable Application Resource (PICSAR) is a 
    high performance repository intended to help scientists porting 
    their Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes to the next generation of 
    exascale computers.

    PICSAR exploits the three levels of parallelism that will be required 
    to achieve good performances on future architectures- distributed 
    memory parallelization (internode), shared memory parallelization 
    (intranode) and vectorization.
    
    PICSARlite is a subset of PICSAR that can be used for testing.

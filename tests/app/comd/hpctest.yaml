  description: >
    CoMD is a reference implementation of classical molecular dynamics
    algorithms and workloads as used in materials science. It is created and
    maintained by The Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme
    Environments (ExMatEx). The code is intended to serve as a vehicle for
    co-design by allowing others to extend and/or reimplement it as needed to
    test performance of new architectures, programming models, etc. New
    versions of CoMD will be released to incorporate the lessons learned from
    the co-design process.

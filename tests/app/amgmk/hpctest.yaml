  description: >
    This microkernel contains three compute-intensive sections of the larger AMG benchmark.
    Optimizing performance for these three sections will improve the figure of merit of AMG.
    AMGmk, like the full AMG benchmark, is written in C. The three sections chosen to create
    this benchmark perform compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix vector multiply, algebraic
    multigrid (AMG) mesh relaxation, and a simple a * X + Y vector operation. OpenMP
    directives allow additional increases in performance. AMGmk uses no MPI parallelism and
    is meant to be studied as a single-CPU benchmark or OpenMP benchmark only. The run time
    of this benchmark is not linearly related to the figure of merit of the larger AMG 
    benchmark because the exact proportion of time spent performing these three operations
    varies depending on the size of the problem and the specific linear system being solved.

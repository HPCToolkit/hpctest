    A Co-design proxy application for the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method 
    (HMM) augmented with adaptive sampling. This source code was used to 
    generate the data in the paper: B. Rouet-Leduc et al., Spatial adaptive 
    sampling in multiscale simulation, Comput. Phys. Commun. 
    185 (2014) 1857-1864 (link). Original authors of the source code 
    include Bertrand Rouet-Leduc and the students of the 2013 Los Alamos 
    Co-Design Summer School. CoHMM is now maintained by ExMatEx: Exascale 
    Co-Design Center for Materials in Extreme Environments (exmatex.org).

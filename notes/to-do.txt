HPCTEST TO DO

- run/repo/repo.yaml needs a unique namespace name for each install

- Spack team is working on support for iterating through concretizations of specs
  (of use in combinatorial testing) "for @tgamblin's planned package build testing".
  Todd: "With the new concretizer we will have a way to iterate through all solutions,
  which would cover this case, but we'd need to provide a syntax for what to explode
  combinatorially and what not to. The test-suite file does some of that, but it
  needs some support for iterating over legal combinations".
  See https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/4530.

HPCTEST TO DO
 
- Fix the (verbose for now) run banner:

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    running test /home/scott/hpctest/tests/app/AMG2006 with config %gcc@4.4.7
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   to show relative test path, include all dimensions, and have longer rules.

 - Batch job submission & polling
 - Robust iteration & continuation
 
 - Alternate input notation based on yaml
 
 - Alternation & wildcards in specs
 
 - Reporting options:
 	- all/pass/fail
 	- sort order
 	- optional summaries
  
 - Separate repo for dependencies
 - Finer grain for checksumming
 - external repo + option to store dependencies there
 
 - Refactor for experiment classes
   
 - Config defaults per platform and site
 
 -----
 
 - Round all times in OUT.yaml to two decimal places. Only some are now.
 
 - Is it good to divide cpu limit among mpi ranks? Or let limit be per node?
 
 
 
 FUTURE WORK
 
 
- Spack team is working on support for iterating through concretizations of specs
  (of use in combinatorial testing) "for @tgamblin's planned package build testing".
  Todd: "With the new concretizer we will have a way to iterate through all solutions,
  which would cover this case, but we'd need to provide a syntax for what to explode
  combinatorially and what not to. The test-suite file does some of that, but it
  needs some support for iterating over legal combinations".
  See https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/4530.

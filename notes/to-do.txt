HPCTEST TO DO


- Intermittent failure of Report.report when a build failed b/c <OUT.yaml>["summary"]["status"] does not exist.


- external repo + option to store dependencies there
 
 
- Generate a top-level _OUT directory with whole-job summary info:
	- OUTs from each run
	- copy of reported table
	- Equivalent of run.log for whole job
	

- Capture into _OUT the spack*out files and any core files produced
- Add variable-weight separators to report to indicate group changes
- Reporting options:
 	- all/pass/fail
 	- sort order
 	- optional summaries
- Fix the (verbose for now) run banner:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    running test /home/scott/hpctest/tests/app/AMG2006 with config %gcc@4.4.7
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   to show relative test path, include all dimensions, and have longer rules.


 - Batch job submission & polling
 - Robust iteration & continuation
 
 
 - Alternate input notation based on yaml
 - Alternation & wildcards in specs
 	- use 'compilerList = spack.compilers.all_compiler_specs()'
 	- or to find versions of a given compiler family,
 	  use e.g. 'compilerList = spack.compilers.find("gcc")'
 	- maybe 'compilerList = 'ppk = PackagePrefs("gcc", "compiler")'
   
   
 - Refactor for experiment classes
 
 
 - Config defaults per platform and site
 
 -----
 - Is it good to divide cpu limit among mpi ranks? Or let limit be per node?

 FUTURE WORK
- Spack team is working on support for iterating through concretizations of specs
  (of use in combinatorial testing) "for @tgamblin's planned package build testing".
  Todd: "With the new concretizer we will have a way to iterate through all solutions,
  which would cover this case, but we'd need to provide a syntax for what to explode
  combinatorially and what not to. The test-suite file does some of that, but it
  needs some support for iterating over legal combinations".
  See https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/4530.

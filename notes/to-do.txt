HPCTEST TO DO

- arrange to automagically set 'verify_ssl: false' in spack/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml
  to avoid download prblems caused by out of date OpenSSL implementations of hosts.

- Spack team is working on support for iterating through concretizations of specs
  (of use in combinatorial testing) "for @tgamblin's planned package build testing".
  Todd: "With the new concretizer we will have a way to iterate through all solutions,
  which would cover this case, but we'd need to provide a syntax for what to explode
  combinatorially and what not to. The test-suite file does some of that, but it
  needs some support for iterating over legal combinations".
  See https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/4530.

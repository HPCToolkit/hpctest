HPCTEST TO DO
 
 - Implement run limits
 
 - Separate repo for dependencies
 - Finer grain for checksumming
 - external repo + option to store dependencies there
 
 - Fix double-quote issue that prevents passing hpctoolkit params on command line
 
 - Alternate input notation based on yaml
 
 - Alternation & wildcards in specs
 
 - Reporting options:
 	- all/pass/fail
 	- sort order
 	- optional summaries
 
 - Config defaults per platform and site
 
 - Batch job submission & polling
 
 - Robust iteration & continuation
 
 - Refactor for experiment classes
 
 
 
 
 FUTURE WORK
 
 
- Spack team is working on support for iterating through concretizations of specs
  (of use in combinatorial testing) "for @tgamblin's planned package build testing".
  Todd: "With the new concretizer we will have a way to iterate through all solutions,
  which would cover this case, but we'd need to provide a syntax for what to explode
  combinatorially and what not to. The test-suite file does some of that, but it
  needs some support for iterating over legal combinations".
  See https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/4530.
